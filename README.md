# Finance News Sentiment Predictor

This project aims to build a system that ingests financial market data and news sentiment to predict movements in financial instruments.  It leverages public data sources such as Yahoo Finance and the FNSPID (Financial News Sentiment Prediction and Item Description) dataset.  The repository is organised to facilitate data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and exposing predictions via a web API.
